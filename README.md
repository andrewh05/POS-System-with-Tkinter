## POS System with Tkinter
# Overview
This project is a simple Point of Sale (POS) system built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to simulate ordering food items and calculates the total price. The user can also process payments, reset the order, or remove items from the order list.

# Features
*Add Food Items*: Select food items from buttons (Kafta, Shawarma, Beef Steak, Tawouk).

*Order List*: Displays the ordered items with their respective prices.

*Order Total*: Automatically updates the total price as items are added or removed.

*Cash Payment*: Users can enter the payment amount, and the system calculates the change or prompts if the payment is insufficient.

*New Order*: Clears the current order and resets the system.

*Delete Item*: Removes a selected item from the order list.

# Usage

The item will be added to the order list and the total price will update.

To reset the order, click on New Order.

To remove an item, select it from the list and click Delete Item.
